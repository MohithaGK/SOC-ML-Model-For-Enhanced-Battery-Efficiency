# SOC-ML-Model-For-Enhanced-Battery-Efficiency
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the Effective State of Charge (SOC) and to generate relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into battery performance metrics, efficiency, and other operational characteristics
